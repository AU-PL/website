title: Installing and using Git
---

In this course you will be assigned a Git source-code repository (or
repo for short) that you will use to turn in all assignments.

# What is Git?

Git is a textfile revision system.  One uses it to manage revisions
of text files between multiple people using a single set of files.
Git will keep track of who made which changes and when (the revision
history), provide tools for undoing and redoing changes (handling
merging), allow remote access to the repository, and even support
multiple time lines of the files (branching).

In this short tutorial I'll go through everything you need to know in
order to use Git in this course.

# The difference between Git and Github

Git is a command-line tool that is installed on your computer to
manage Git repositories of textfiles.  When using Git on your computer
the repositories are local, but Git has the ability to share them
remotely with others.  This is where Github comes in.

Github is a hosting site for Git repositories.  If you want to share
your repo with a team of other people then you can host it on Github
and allow others to subscribe to it. Github allows them be able to
download your repositories, change it, and even submit changes back to
the repository on Github for you to have as well.

# Installing Git

First we need to get Git on your computer if it's not there already.
If you are running Linux, you are done, and can skip this section.
Otherwise, Mac OS X users need only open the Terminal app, and type
`git` at the command line.  If Git's not install already, then it will
tell you what you need to do.

So if you're a Windows user, then please install Git from
[here](https://git-scm.com/ ).  This is all you need to install to use
Git in this course.

This will install a command line interface to Git called GitBash, and
it looks like [this](https://gitforwindows.org/img/gw1.png ).  I like
using the command line, because the same commands work no matter which
operating system you are using.  Thus, I can help everyone using the
same solutions to problems we run into.

Throughout the remainder of this tutorial I will say "open the
command line" to mean open either the terminal on Unix-based systems
(Linux, Mac OS X, etc) or GitBash on Windows.

# Setting up Git

We now need to setup Git on your computer so that it knows who you
are. This is independent of your Github username and email, and is
setting up your local Git install to record your name and email when
telling Git about your revisions.

- Your name:

  ```
  > git config --global user.name "John Doe"
  ```

  Replace "John Doe" with your full name.  This is the name Git will
  use to record your changes in the revision history.
  
- Your email:

  ```
  > git config --global user.email jdoe@augusta.edu
  ```

  The revision history also records your email.  Set this to your AU
  email address.
  
This completes the Git basic setup.

# Cloning your repo

__At this point you have emailed me with your
[Github](https://www.github.com ) login and I have replied with the
link to your Git repo.  If not, then please do this step first.__

Now we will __clone__ your repo that I have created for you, and that
is hosted on Github, to your computer so that you can use it.  

First create a folder on your computer that you will use to keep
everything in this class in.  I'll call it `pl_dir` in this tutorial.
Then open the command line and navigate to `pl_dir`:

```
> cd path_to_pl_dir/pl_dir
```

At this point you have changed your working directory to `pl_dir`.
You can check that this worked by running the command:

```
> pwd
```

This stands for "present working directory".

Now that your working directory is `pl_dir` we can clone your course
repository using the following command:

```
> git clone URL
```

replace `URL` with the URL I sent you.

Now check to make sure that the clone was successful (if it weren't
you should have gotten an error message):

```
> ls 
```

This command is "list files" and simply lists all the files in your
working directory.  If you see your repo, then you are good to
go. Otherwise an error happened, and so try again, but if you can't
figure it out, then ask on Slack.

You only ever need to clone a repository once.  Unless you delete the
folder you will never have to clone this repository again.

# Editing files in your repo

A Git repo is just a special directory that Git knows about.  Once
it's cloned to your computer you can treat it as a standard folder on
your computer that is full of textfiles that are managed by Git.  The
only time you need to use the command line or Git is when you are ready
to tell Git about the changes you've made.

So to get an idea of how this works.  Using the file explorer (Finder
on Mac OS X) go and take a look at your repo in `pl_dir`.    The first
time you clone your repo it will contain the following files:

- `git_tutorial` : Some example files for this tutorial.

When you are working on your assignments you can use your computers
graphical based means of exploring files and folders, and simply treat
the files as normal files.  Open them with editors and save them, etc.

Let's do an example.  Open `git_tutorial/example.txt` in your favorite
text editor.  Answer the question and save it.

Now we are going to tell Git about your changes, commit them to the
revision history, and then push them to Github where I can see and get
your changes too.

Open the command line and move into the the `git_tutorial` folder:

```
> cd path_to_pl_dir/pl_dir/git_tutorial
```

Now tell Git about your changes by committing them:

```
> git commit -a -m 'Answered the question.'
```

This is adds all the changes you've made to the files in your working
directory to the revision history.  This is a completely local
operation, it doesn't communicate it to Github.

You can see the revision history using the command:

```
> git log
```

This lists all the changes by everyone who've made changes to the
files in your repo.  For example, you will see mine listed as well,
and I will see yours.  Notice your name and email are showing up, this
is the result of the setup we did earlier.

The command `git commit -a -m` says you want to commit each change to
the files in my working directory using the commit message provided;
we used `'Answered the question'`.  This message should be a detailed
description of the changes you have made.  As you can see in the
revision history when using `git log` this shows up in the history.
I'll read these to see what you have done.

You are now ready to share your changes with Github.  To do this,
__push__ your changes upstream:

```
> git push
```

This sends all of your recent commits to Github so that everyone who
subscribes to your repository can get your changes.

# Fetching changes from Github

The last Git operation you will need for this course is a means of
fetching or __pulling__ recent changes by people other than you from
Github.  For example, I'll be adding your assignments to your
repository throughout the semester, and so, you will need to get them
from Github into your repository.

First, move into your repository:

```
> cd path_to_pl_dir/pl_dir
```

Make sure you have no modified files Git doesn't know about, because
you have never committed them.  Do the following:

```
> git status

On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

If you see the above message, then you are good to go, all changes
have been committed to your revision history. If you see something
that looks like:

```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   markdown/git.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

Then you have untracked changes that need to be committed. Go back to
the previous section and commit your changes before proceeding.  There
can be no non-committed changes when we pull from Github, because Git
will merge all changes together.

To pull all changes from Github into your local repository do:

```
> git pull
```

within your repository.  Note that all Git commands must be within
your repository.  That is, your present working directory must be your
repository; in this tutorial it has been `pl_dir`.

# Recommended work flow

When using Git for this course and completing assignments I recommend
the following work flow:

1. Open the command line and move into your repository using the `cd`
   command.
   
2. Pull all new changes from Github using `git pull`.

3. Do your work by making changes to the files.

4. After you are done working commit your changes using `git commit -a
   -m 'MESSAGE'`. Commit after you work every time no matter if your
   done with your assignment or not.  This keeps your repository
   clean. 
   
5. After you commit push your changes to Github using `git push`.  Do
   this every time you're done working too.  You can push as many times
   as you like.  Committing and pushing every time your done working
   on your assignments keeps Git happy.
   
6. Bob's your uncle!

And that's all you need to know about Git for this class.
